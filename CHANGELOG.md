## [1.0.4] - 2021-Jan-15

### Fixed

- rgbddemux: Source pads are now reconfigured if new upstream CAPS are received.

## [1.0.3] - 2020-Dec-15

### Fixed

- Enforce that some streams become the main stream if they are available.
  - This fixes a bug where `dddqmeta` could become the main buffer for non determenistic
    pad adds.

## [1.0.2] - 2020-Dec-1

### Fixed

- `rgbdmux`
  - Some files contain framerate numerator equal to 0. Added condition where numerator is changed to 30 when this happens.

## [1.0.1] - 2020-Oct-26

### Fixed

- `rgbdmux`
  - Downstream requests for video format are now correctly sent to the upstream element(s), even if their linking is delayed. Previously, video format forwarding could fail if `rgbdmux` was linked with upstream (e.g. in NULL state) before downsteam (e.g. in READY state).

## [1.0.0] - 2020-Oct-02

### Changed

- Refactored elements into submodules.
- `rgbdmux`
  - Default value for property `drop-if-missing` to _false_, as it is not needed in most pipelines and it causes unnecessary amount of buffers to get dropped.
- `rgbddemux`
  - Changed presence of src pad to _sometimes_ instead of _request_.

### Fixed

- Several review comments from Sebastian DrÃ¶ge for both `rgbdmux` and `rgbddemux`. Thank you for your feedback!
  - Refactored mutexes to eliminate known places of possible deadlocks.
  - `rgbdmux`
    - Downstream requests for video format are now correctly sent to the upstream element(s).
    - Forwarding of EOS - EOS is now send in `aggregate()` when all sink pads are marked as EOS.
    - Output CAPS for MJPG stream, i.e. format is now properly specified for downstream elements.
  - `rgbddemux`
    - Element no longer attempts to push buffers to pads that are not linked.
      - This allowed to make use of FlowCombiner in sink chain, which was disabled until now.
    - Group ID of upstream is now used during pushing of stream-start events.
    - Unneeded src pads are now removed if new sink CAPS were negotiated.
    - Internal src pads now contain the name of the stream instead of the pad name, as it was not consistent with the documentation.

## [0.5.4] - 2020-Sep-07

### Fixed

- Timestamps in GAP events - use proper timestamps instead of current clock time.
- Fix incorrect computation of the frame duration for GAP event.

## [0.5.3] - 2020-Sep-04

### Fixed

- Building this plugin as Gst version 1.16 instead of 1.17.

## [0.5.2] - 2020-Sep-02

### Updated

- Update GStreamer bindings version and various minor cleanups/fixes.

## [0.5.1] - 2020-Aug-21

### Changed

- Fall back to the default pad event handling - fixes EOS not being forwarded correctly in ~50% if cases. Credit to @slomo for the fix.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-Jul-22

### Changed

- Re-implemented the stream-id generation on rgbddemux, so that it follows the GStreamer
  documentation:

> The stream_id should be a unique string that consists of the upstream stream-id, / as separator
> and a unique stream-id for this specific stream. A new stream-id should only be created for a
> stream if the upstream stream is split into (potentially) multiple new streams, e.g. in a demuxer,
> but not for every single element in the pipeline.

## [0.4.1] - 2020-Jul-01

### Changed

- Add gstreamer conan config, bump cargo deps to gst-depth-meta-rs

## [0.4.0] - 2020-Apr-07

### Changed

- Update dependencies
  - `glib` to 0.9
  - `gst` to 0.15

## 0.3.1 - 2020-Apr-02

### Fixed

- `rgbdmux` - Fixed EOS forwarding by implementing custom `sink_event()` handling.
- `rgbdmux` - No longer tries to renegotiate CAPS once EOS was received and the element is shutting down.

## 0.3.0 - 2020-Mar-10

### Added

- `rgbddemux` - Added `distribute-timestamps` property that enables distribution of the main buffer timestamps to the auxiliary buffers embedded within the `video/rbgd` stream. The property defaults to _false_ and must be explicitly enabled to cause any difference from the previous version.

## 0.2.3 - 2020-Mar-04

### Modified

- Use of standard function for work with `video/rgbd` CAPS from `gst_depth_meta::rgbd` module, instead of custom-local implementation.

## 0.2.2 - 2020-Jan-28

### Added

- Support for MJPG

## 0.2.1 - 2020-Jan-24

### Added

- `rgbdmux` - CAPS negotiation of video formats with downstream element, conversion of these formats from `video/rgbd` to `video/x-raw` and subsequent use of the requested formats during creation of new sink pads.

## 0.2.0 - 2020-Jan-21

### Removed

- Partial KLV packing. `rgbddemux` now forwards the buffers simply as Cap'n Proto serialised buffers

### Changed

- `rgbddemux` and `rgbdmux` now treats per-frame metadata as top-level streams. This means that they're also included in the `streams` field of the `video/rgbd` CAPS.

## 0.1.6

### Added

- `rgbdmux` - If `drop-if-missing` is set to false, there is no deadline for the aggregation. This makes deadline based aggregation optional. If `drop-if-missing` is set to true, the behaviour is identical to `0.1.5`.
- `rgbdmux` - Added `deadline-multiplier` property that controls the duration of deadline if `drop-if-missing` is enabled.

### Changed

- `rgbdmux` - Split `internals` into `sink_pads` and `settings` to avoid the possibility of deadlock caused by Mutex, which was introduced by the new additions.

## 0.1.5

### Added

- `rgbdmux` - Dropping of all other frames if one of the sink pads does not have a buffer queued, see property `drop-if-missing`.
- `rgbdmux` - Synchronisation of buffers by dropping buffers that are late, see property `drop-to-synchronise`.

## 0.1.4

### Added

- Metadata support: The `rgbddemux` reads per-frame metadata on the frame buffers and pushes them to a sink-pad called _dddqmeta_. Similarly, if the rgbd CAPS contains a stream called _dddqmeta_, its content is also outputted on the _dddqmeta_ sink.

### Changed

- Peer elements may now request pads on the `rgbddemux`, which may be linked when CAPS are available
- `rgbdmux` does downstream CAPS negotiation when sink pads are requested on the element

### Known issues

- Requesting a pad on the `rgbddemux` which is not in the `video/rgbd` stream will cause the pipeline to freeze

## 0.1.3

### Patched

- This patch fixes a bug introduces in 0.1.2 which caused the rgbddemux to return a gst::FlowError when it attempts to push meta buffer for which it does not have a pad.
