# Aivero Contrib

These are the open source componets developed and maintained by Aivero.

- The `aivero-rgbd-toolkit` is the GStreamer based toolkit for interfacing with RGB-D cameras such as the Intel RealSense and Microsoft Azure Kinect cameras. We very much welcome MR/PRs for additional camera support.
- Every `gst-` prefixed subfolder contains a GStreamer element.
- The `recipes` subfolder contains `conanfile.py`-only conan.io packages of external software.
